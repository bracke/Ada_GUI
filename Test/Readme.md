# Test Programs

This directory contains three test programs for Ada GUI.

Show_All creates at least one of each widget. Visibility, playing audio, and responding to key-press events is demonstrated. Changing this program is the easiest way to experiment with Ada GUI. The audio file  glass.ogg is used by Show_All.

Luhn_Gen calculates Luhn checksum digits. Enter the first 15 digits of your credit-card number and it will generate the 16th.

Random_Int is a Gnoga program (https://github.com/jrcarter/Random_Int) that has been revised to use Ada GUI instead. It will generate random integers in a desired range.

Ada-GUI versions of Mine_Detector (https://github.com/jrcarter/Mine_Detector) and Password_Gen (https://github.com/jrcarter/Password_Gen) will be uploaded soon.
