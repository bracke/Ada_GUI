# Test Programs

This directory contains three test programs for Ada GUI.

Show_All creates at least one of each widget. Visibility, playing audio, and responding to key-press events is demonstrated. Changing this program is the easiest way to experiment with Ada GUI. The audio file  glass.ogg is used by Show_All.

Luhn_Gen calculates Luhn checksum digits. Enter the first 15 digits of your credit-card number and it will generate the 16th. Note that Luhn_Gen uses PragmARC.Luhn_Generation from the [PragmAda Reusable_Components](https://github.com/jrcarter/PragmARC).

Random_Int is a [Gnoga program](https://github.com/jrcarter/Random_Int) that has been revised to use Ada GUI instead. It will generate random integers in a desired range.

Ada-GUI versions of [Mine_Detector](https://github.com/jrcarter/Mine_Detector), [Password_Gen](https://github.com/jrcarter/Password_Gen) and [MP](https://github.com/jrcarter/MP) are available.
